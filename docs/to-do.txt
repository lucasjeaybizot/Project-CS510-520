# Fix all the self-flagged warnings

# Implement different combinations of channels weights (rather than mean())

# Include a coefficient in the convolution in model A to control the signal-to-noise ratio

# Profile the code more --> try to find a way to turn into functions most of the actions

# Create output visualisation (with possibility of storage - using prompt - in a result folder)

# Add more than one subject possibility in the data_length_finder ?

# Add a prompt in the data_length_finder to pick between model A and model B
