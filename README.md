# Project-CS510-520
Repository for the project in CS510 and CS520

* By Lucas Jeay-Bizot

# Navigating

Please find in this repository code to simulate EEG data (based off real EEG-data parameters) with a special event "RP" and then generate a forecast matrix of the probability of future events

# How to run the code

Start by running "EEG_simulator.R" to generate a baseline EEG data
Then run "modelA_generator.R" to add the "RP" events on the data

Proceed to generate a forecast map of future events by running "forecast_matrix.R"

An exemple of output map can be found in "output_exemple.csv"
